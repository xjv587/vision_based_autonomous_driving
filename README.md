### Vision-Based Autonomous Driving with Deep Learning

I developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for vision-based autonomous driving in SuperTuxKart. The project involved:

✅ Low-Level Controller: Engineered a rule-based controller to steer a kart using game-state information. Tuned hyperparameters for optimal driving performance across multiple tracks.

✅ Data Collection & Processing: Captured a large dataset of images and corresponding steering targets using the controller, creating a foundation for supervised learning.

✅ Deep Learning Model: Designed and trained a CNN-based planner to predict steering points from raw images. Leveraged encoder-decoder architecture and a spatial argmax layer for precise aim-point detection.

✅ Evaluation & Optimization: Fine-tuned the model for real-time inference, benchmarked performance on multiple tracks, and ensured generalization to unseen environments.
